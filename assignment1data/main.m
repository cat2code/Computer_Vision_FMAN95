%Answer: 
% The lines are not parallell, they all intersect. They intersect close to
% each other but still distinctly not all intersecting in the same point.
% This is interesting as the lines should be almost parallell to each other
% in the 3D world that they were taken photo of. There are many instances
% that introduce room for error that the lines are not exactly parallell 
% so that they do not intersect in the same point in our plot.
% What is interesting is that they are still enough parallel-alike to 
% almost intersect in the same point.

% Calculate intersection point bewteen p2 and p3 lines
p2_p3_point = null([p2_intersect_line p3_intersect_line]');
p2_p3_point = p2_p3_point./p2_p3_point(3);

p2_p3_point_c = p2_p3_point(1:2);        % Intersection point in cartesian

x1 = p2_p3_point_c(1);
x2 = p2_p3_point_c(2);

plot(x1,x2,'*')
legend('p1','p2','p3','intersection p2 p3');

% Calculate distance between intersection point and p1 line
a = p1_intersect_line(1);
b = p1_intersect_line(2);
c = p1_intersect_line(3);

d = abs(a*x1 + b*x2 + c)/sqrt(a^2 + b^2); % d = 8.1950
save('distance','d')

% Answer: Distinctly not zero. The distance is relatively small though.
% This ties into the discussion above.

%%% Answer %%%
% Classification of transformations:
% H1 - Euclidian transformation
%       Preserves the size and shape of the original grid. Only rotattion.
% H2 - Similarity Transform
%       Rotation but does not preserve size of the shape. 
% H3 - Affine transformation
%       Typical shape for affine transformation and preserving paralel
%       lines. It also has an appropiate transformation matrix with [A t;0 1]
% H4 - Projective Transformation
%       All other were chosen so this is the only one left. We can see 
%       though that all straight lines are preserved as it should but the 
%       angles between them are not preserved which is not required. 
%       The transformation is otherwise arbitrary.

% ANSWER:
% The results are not entirely reasonable, yet! The point figure looks good
% and the center points for the cameras look very reasonable comparing with
% the images. The same goes for the angle. Very cool!
% The plot could be improved so that the statue is vertical, that would
% have looked more nice...
