% The script concludes by plotting the objective value vs. iteration number to visualize the optimization process. The use of Steepest Descent method aims to minimize the sum of residuals, which represents the reprojection error, by iteratively updating the solution in the direction that decreases this error the most at each step. The choice of Î³_k is critical for the success of the convergence, and in this script, a very small value is used to ensure a careful approach towards the minimum.
